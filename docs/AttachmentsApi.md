## CreateAttachmentForObject

> GetAttachment200Response CreateAttachmentForObject (bool? optPretty = null, List<string> optFields = null, string resourceSubtype = null, System.IO.Stream file = null, string parent = null, string url = null, string name = null)

Upload an attachment

Upload an attachment.  This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:  - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API  The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.  This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.  Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\\r\\n` outlined [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

## GetAttachmentsForObject

> GetAttachmentsForObject200Response GetAttachmentsForObject (string parent, bool? optPretty = null, List<string> optFields = null, int? limit = null, string offset = null)

Get attachments from an object

Returns the compact records for all attachments on the object.  There are three possible `parent` values for this request: `project`, `project_brief`, and `task`. For a project, an attachment refers to a file uploaded to the \"Key resources\" section in the project Overview. For a project brief, an attachment refers to inline files in the project brief itself. For a task, an attachment refers to a file directly associated to that task.
