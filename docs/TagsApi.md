## CreateTag

> CreateTag201Response CreateTag (CreateTagRequest createTagRequest, bool? optPretty = null, List<string> optFields = null)

Create a tag

Creates a new tag in a workspace or organization.  Every tag is required to be created in a specific workspace or organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use the workspace parameter regardless of whether or not it is an organization.  Returns the full record of the newly created tag.

### Example

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using asana.Api;
using asana.Client;
using asana.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class CreateTagExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration.Default.BasePath = "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
            Configuration.Default.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";
            // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
            Configuration.Default.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new TagsApi(Configuration.Default);
            var createTagRequest = new CreateTagRequest(); // CreateTagRequest | The tag to create.
            var optPretty = true;  // bool? | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional) 
            var optFields = new List<string>(); // List<string> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Create a tag
                CreateTag201Response result = apiInstance.CreateTag(createTagRequest, optPretty, optFields);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling TagsApi.CreateTag: " + e.Message );

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **optPretty** | **bool?**| Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. | [optional] 
 **optFields** | [**List&lt;string&gt;**](string.md)| Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. | [optional] 
 **limit** | **int?**| Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. | [optional] 
 **offset** | **string**| Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. &#39;Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.&#39; | [optional] 
 **workspace** | **string**| The workspace to filter tags on. | [optional] 

### Return type

[**GetTags200Response**](GetTags200Response.md)

### Authorization

[oauth2](../README.md#oauth2), [personalAccessToken](../README.md#personalAccessToken)

### HTTP request headers

- **Content-Type**: Not defined
- **Accept**: application/json


### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** | Successfully retrieved the specified set of tags. |  -  |
| **400** | This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again. |  -  |
| **401** | A valid authentication token was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a user with the request. |  -  |
| **403** | The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. |  -  |
| **404** | Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. |  -  |
| **500** | There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. |  -  |

## UpdateTag

> CreateTag201Response UpdateTag (string tagGid, bool? optPretty = null, List<string> optFields = null, int? limit = null, string offset = null)

Update a tag

Updates the properties of a tag. Only the fields provided in the `data` block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.  When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since you last retrieved the tag.  Returns the complete updated tag record.
